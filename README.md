# sTEAtus

This repository contains an early code base for the sTEAtus project, a web application designed to help individuals with autism communicate their emotional state. The frontend now includes basic styling with Tailwind CSS and a small set of pages.

## Structure

- `frontend/` - React application created with Vite. Includes pages for Home, Profile, Status, and Settings, along with a styled navigation bar.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to `frontend` and run `npm install` to install dependencies (requires internet access).
2. Use `npm run dev` to start the development server.
3. Customize Firebase configuration in `src/firebase/firebase.js`.

The default theme uses the Inter font and a violet primary color. You can adjust these in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Features TODO

The backlog includes authentication, subscriptions, push notifications, acknowledgements, accessibility settings, and more. These features are not yet implemented in this repository but are planned for future development.
