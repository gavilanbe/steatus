# sTEAtus

This repository contains a minimal code base for the sTEAtus project, a web application designed to help individuals with autism communicate their emotional state. The project is currently in an early stage and provides only a skeleton for the frontend built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Structure

- `frontend/` - React application created with Vite (not yet installed). Includes basic pages: Home, Profile, Status, and Settings.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to `frontend` and run `npm install` to install dependencies (requires internet access).
2. Use `npm run dev` to start the development server.
3. Customize Firebase configuration in `src/firebase/firebase.js`.

## Features TODO

The backlog includes authentication, subscriptions, push notifications, acknowledgements, accessibility settings, and more. These features are not yet implemented in this repository but are planned for future development.
